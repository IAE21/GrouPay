   Description:
   - GrouPay is a web application designed to facilitate users in reconciling collective debts, by allowing individuals to join billing groups, in which they can independently contribute to bills owed by themselves and their peers within the same billing group. Users must first make accounts in order to find the other users with which to join the same billing group, set up by a third party such as a landlord (or property manager, company, etc.), after which they can split bills, such as rent or utilities evenly, and/or distribute percentages of the balance due however they decide. This way, users are individually held accountable for their own parts of the total balance due, simplifying the process of collectively managing mutual expenses.

   Problem Statement:
   - Being college students ourselves, weâ€™ve had our fair share of roommates along the way, and have had to manage the ordeal of paying bills through other people, or doing it ourselves for things like common appliances and shared goods, which is not always a pleasant experience. Considering most college dorm mates or roommates are strangers, it is difficult and often uncomfortable to hold others accountable for such expenses. However, this project will make it concretely evident who is not pulling their weight, simplifying the conversation for all those involved.
